# Gameplay

Tuning defaults live in `ERServer::Settings()`: that whitelist is the source of truth
for keys, units and ranges. Numbers below describe Standard values.

**Code:** `ERMatch`, `ERCharacter`, `ERMovement`, `ERLadder`, `ERPostureMesh`, `ERPlayerController`, `ERMenu`, `ERBotController`, `ERCorpse`, `ERServerSettings`, `ERLobbyRules`, `ERGameplayMessages`.

## Match

- Two teams, **Alpha** (CT role in reference maps, blue) and **Omega** (T role, orange).
- Team deathmatch: 600s, first to 50, 1 point per enemy kill, 10s intermission.
- Server voting and rotation use production maps only. Rounds consume every template
  once in random order before reshuffling, avoiding a repeat across the boundary.
- A lobby READY needs a strict majority of humans present (`Match.ReadyPercent`).
- Respawn is requested by the player after 3s (fire or jump; the press is consumed).
  Spawn protection lasts 4s, renders the character opaque gray through one transient
  MID, and ends on expiry or attack.
- Dead characters leave a replicated cosmetic ragdoll that touches only WorldStatic,
  capped at 12, removed by the server after 30s and cleared on round reset.
- No overhead player markers; `TeamMarker` stays hidden for serialized compatibility.
- Modes: Local, Create server, Connect as client. Session setup selects a map, 0–10 bots
  per team (additional to human capacity) and their behaviour.

## Bots

Opt-in only: ordinary hosting has none. Bots share combat, team, scoring and respawn
rules. Modes: stationary **Target**, **Movement** only (never fires), **Patrol/Combat**.
Movement bots run server-only staggered 22s posture cycles and use normal movement
intents, with bounded local obstacle searches (12 directions, 7m, every 2s). Smoke
does not affect bot vision. Stationary targets keep team, skin and start across respawns.

## Movement

| Action | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Capsule | 185cm standing, 68cm wide, eye 170cm; half height 92.5, crouched 62.5 |
| Walk (Shift) / run / sprint | 7.5 / 15 / 27 km/h |
| Crouch / crawl / posture transition | 150 / 82.5 / 67.5 cm/s |
| Ladder, light item / heavy weapon stowed | 216 / 270 cm/s |
| Stamina | 15s of sprint, 20s full recovery from empty, also while running |
| Auto step / vault / climb | 30 / 80 / 150 cm above current feet |
| Crouch / prone transition | 0.4s / 1.1s |
| Fall damage | safe ≤3m, lethal from 11m; bypasses armor, authority only |

Sprint: double-tap W within 300ms and hold, or hold E with W. Partial stamina can be
spent by a fresh gesture; a held key never auto-restarts. Hold Ctrl/C to crouch, double
tap to latch prone, press again to rise; standing waits for ceiling clearance. Forward
input vaults; Space+forward climbs, also while airborne. `FindLedge` handles parapets
down to 20cm wide.

Ladders use custom movement mode 2 (1 is mantle, 3 is the ladder-to-roof transition).
W/S climbs, Space detaches. Pistols, knives and hand grenades stay usable; other
weapons stow automatically and return on exit. Rungs must physically survive.

Traversal uses `UERMovement` and saved moves. `IA_Look` scalar is 0.18. Camera bob is
cosmetic. FPS arms, weapon and muzzle flash render as FirstPerson primitives.

## Controls

WASD, mouse, left click fire, right click scope, Space jump/climb/respawn, Shift walk,
double-tap W or hold E sprint, Ctrl/C crouch and prone, R reload, 1–8 / F / G / H or
wheel select (the wheel has a 250ms quiet period), Tab scoreboard, Esc menu.
Menus, HUD and labels are English; the language is forced at GameInstance init.

## Server settings

**Start Server → Gameplay settings**: categories, basic/advanced fields, per-value
resets, Standard reset and named presets. Saved in GameUserSettings under
`RespawnAndRage.ServerRules`, `.ServerPresets`, `.ServerPreset.<name>`. Dedicated and
direct launches can set `[RespawnAndRage.ServerRules]` in Game.ini:

```ini
Move.Sprint=27
Smoke.Radius=6
Weapon.HE.ExplosionRadius=6
Kit.rifleman.offense.HE=3
```

Starting a session copies the draft to an immutable snapshot, which `AERGameState::
ServerRules` replicates. Weapons derive private effective copies through `Tuned()`;
authored assets stay untouched. Kit values are final carried quantities. Client saved
preferences never apply to another server. Configuration exposes existing mechanics
only; it adds no slots or systems. Material rules travel in the cell descriptor.

`Map.ExpectedTeamSize` (1–16, default 2) is fixed at creation and shown read-only in
the lobby. See [MAPS.md](MAPS.md).

## Gameplay messages

`Config/GameplayMessages/respawn-and-rage-gameplay-messages.en-US.json` is the owner's
catalog, preserved byte for byte (72 events, 720 variants). `UERGameplayMessages` loads
it and dispatches the 40 connected events; the rest need extra telemetry.

Every confirmed kill sends a private reliable RPC to both players, bypassing
cooldown and priority. Teamkills, self-inflicted and unattributed deaths are labelled.
Canvas shows up to three confirmations for 6s plus one bonus toast, top left, silent.
Runtime durations double the catalog values. Shuffle bags use a separate RNG, per
player/event/audience. Thresholds keep the catalog suggestions: 40m longshot, ≤10HP,
5/10/15/20/25 streaks, four unanswered kills, 4s rapid chain gap.

The death camera moves from above the body toward the killer, zooming 90→60° and
framing the body at about 65% height, with sphere sweeps. It is purely cosmetic.

## Original scope

Excluded unless requested: pickups, corpse loot, matchmaking, health regeneration,
automatic respawn, bomb or capture modes. Competitive balance needs real playtests.
