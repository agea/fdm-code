# Characters

**Code:** `ERTeamAppearance.h`, `ERPostureMesh`, `ERCorpse`, `ERMenuPreview`, `scripts/character_catalog.py`.

## Catalog

20 selectable skins, 10 per team (`ERSkins::Count`), with stable indices. Labels come from
`scripts/character_catalog.py`; saved legacy IDs resolve as aliases.

| Index | Alpha (blue) | Omega (orange) |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | Wraith · Officer | Drongo · Raider |
| 1 | Wraith · Assault | Drongo · Jackal |
| 2 | Wraith · Patrol | Drongo · Assault |
| 3 | Twinblast · Recon | Drongo · Smuggler |
| 4 | Twinblast · Support | Drongo · Militia |
| 5 | Belica · Infantry | Gadget · Recon |
| 6 | Belica · Arctic Patrol | Gadget · Mechanic |
| 7 | Belica · NBC Defense | Gadget · Patrol |
| 8 | Belica · Armored | Gadget · Field Engineer |
| 9 | Belica · Support | Gadget · Veteran |

Note that the gallery counts from 1: "gallery 8" is index 7. Role assignments are in
[EQUIPMENT.md](EQUIPMENT.md). Appearances live in three catalogs that must agree:
`BP_ERCharacter`, `BP_ERTrainingTarget`, `BP_ERCorpse`. Each team has a canonical fallback
(Alpha: Officer; Omega: Raider). Corpses keep the skin worn at death.

## Visual rules

- Matte blue/neutral Alpha and muted orange/neutral Omega, with natural skin and hair, neutral
  lower gear, no hero emissive. Belica and Drongo use owned muted materials (Belica blue
  `(.12,.28,.52)`, Drongo ochre about `(.62,.29,.115)`, desaturation .85, white lift .08/.10) marked
  `ERMutedLegacyPalette=1`, so `setup_team_readability.py` skips them. Do not brighten.
- Hide original weapons and tech props through material sections or hidden bones, without
  hiding body or head bones. No backpack attachments on selectable skins.
- Wraith 0/1/2 are the OD Green, base and Lunar Ops costumes. Officer has Twinblast Officer's
  sunglasses head on the live head bone (`SK_ER_WraithOfficer_Unmasked`); Assault has
  Twinblast Support's head; Patrol stays masked. `restore_wraith_assault_mask.py` undoes Assault.
- Drongo Jackal keeps Scavenger's goggles, skull bandana and pad (material slot 0, misleadingly
  `M00_Teddybear`), through owned `M_ER_Scavenger_FieldMask`; marker `ERScavengerOriginalHead`
  protects it from `setup_drongo_masks.py`. The atlas R channel is white BaseColor paint.
- Gadget · Patrol is the Sniper look. Veteran's Shellshock is an optional catalog choice;
  Gadget's authored skin masks must survive tinting on both body sections.
- Gadget Recon/Mechanic/Patrol share an owned shadow PhysicsAsset to avoid the vendor Rig.

## Rig and animation

- FPS: `Characters/FirstPerson/SKEL_ER_FirstPerson`, independent of world skins. Skin FPS
  meshes keep only forearm and hand geometry. Never move or scale a hero body to frame arms.
  `setup_skin_first_person_forearms.py` builds them; `-ERFPSForearmsGallery` captures them.
- Cooked playback: see the FPS clips note in [PACKAGE_MAC.md](PACKAGE_MAC.md).
- Ragdolls: owned `PA_ER_{Alpha,Omega}_Ragdoll`, 16 bodies/15 joints. Corpse meshes collapse
  hidden bones in `ERCorpseMeshComponent::FinalizeBoneTransform`.
- Prone is procedural on team rigs through `UERPostureMesh`. Its extra hit volume stops at death.
- Ground contact: `FeetOffset = -92.5 - soleHeight`, measured from foot vertices across the
  idle clip by `setup_character_grounding.py`. Rerun after an explicit catalog rebuild. No terrain IK.

## Clothing

Owned cloth meshes use embedded `ER_FieldClothCollision`, reusing Twinblast's authored
collision and separate from gameplay physics: 24cm travel, 3cm backstops, CCD, 1.2cm thickness,
4 iterations / 2 substeps. All render LODs keep their own mapping. In UE 5.8 bind with
`FSkeletalMeshClothingSystemUtilities::AssignClothingToSection`; `BindToSkeletalMesh` alone loses it.
`setup_field_clothing.py -ERClothOnly` saves only owned meshes.

`AERMenuPreview` needs `bWaitForParallelClothTask` before its manual `CaptureScene`; test
cloth through that real preview. It keeps `bForceMipStreaming` for capture detail, scoped to
that component. `test-field-clothing.py` proves simulation; screenshots alone cannot.

## Rebuild

Approved skins are saved and ready. Source packs were pruned to the runtime closure, so
historical import scripts need archived inputs and are not launch steps. Original art is
immutable. Validate the state with `scripts/verify_runtime_characters.py` against
`docs/CHARACTER_RUNTIME_STATE.json`, which lists hashes and deleted packages.
`setup_*`/`verify_*` pairs exist per skin family. Keep Paragon geometry limits in mind:
do not claim cybernetic limbs became human.

## Verify

`test-team-skins.py`, `test-target-skins.py`, `test-world-poses.py`, `test-field-clothing.py --render --preview`,
`test-character-preview.py`, `verify_runtime_characters.py`, `test-network.py --skins`.
