# Village

Shared rules are in [MAPS.md](../MAPS.md).

**Code:** `ERVillage.cpp`.

Inspired by the owner's Shoots references; no Shoots geometry imported. Recipe in `Village` struct:
1–5 central blocks (20–30m × 6–8m), paired or one self-symmetric origin block, 1–3 platform
storeys from 2.4m, budget of 10 floors.

- Ground blocks enclose three timber bays around two dogleg passages; bays are breachable.
- Each base has a variant (gallery, covered porch or barracks), a corner lookout, a side shack
  with roof access. Lateral walls 240cm, with standing bypasses recorded in `VillageSideWalls`
  and `VillageSideBypasses`.
- 3v3+ uses at least two blocks; paired 4.8×2.4m L shelters meet a ground-cover quota that upper
  floors cannot satisfy.
- Perimeter: tapered 3.8–4.4m logs with real shot gaps, plus a hidden locomotion-only wall.
- Backdrop: J&E Gray Park panorama (Greg Zaal, CC0), exterior trees, all skipped on dedicated.
- Known defect: a few roof beams and pieces of the storage body have no support and fall at the
  first damage anywhere on the map. See `fresh-support.csv` in
  [destruction stress](../PROCEDURAL_MAP_PLAYABILITY.md#destruction-stress).
