# Respawn & Rage — agent guide

Current rules and current state only. History lives in Git: the long chronological
docs were removed after commit `d292554`, so `git show d292554:AGENTS.md` (or
`:docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `:docs/TEST_RESULTS.md`) recovers old reasoning when needed.

## Project

- Tactical multiplayer FPS, tagline **Serious guns. Questionable players**.
  Unreal Engine **5.8.3**, `RespawnAndRage.uproject`, targets `RespawnAndRage` and
  `RespawnAndRageEditor`, build settings V7, include order `Unreal5_8`.
- Sibling repositories under `/Users/agea/git/respawn-and-rage/`: `core` (this
  public repo), `unreal-builder` (Fargate/EC2 build infrastructure), `website`.
  `_cache` holds private LFS caches and `builds/` packaging output.
- Licensed content lives in three private submodules (`Assets/characters`,
  `Assets/weapons`, `Assets/maps`), mounted into the ignored `Content/` and
  `SourceAssets/` by `scripts/setup-assets.py`.
- Keep the internal identifiers `fdm`, `/Script/fdm`, `/Game/EclipseRecoil` and the
  `EclipseRecoil.*` settings/test names: serialized assets and saved preferences
  depend on them. Never show them to players.
- Native code is one module, `Source/fdm` (flat directory, `ER*` prefix).

## What to read

Read **only** the row for the task, not `docs/` as a whole and not the README. Open another doc
only when the task really crosses into it. Each doc starts with a **Code** line and ends with
**Verify**: start from those files, grep `Source/fdm` (flat, 230 files), and read large files such
as `ERCharacter.cpp` by range.

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Add or change a weapon, damage, scope, weapon pose | [WEAPONS](docs/WEAPONS.md) |
| Accuracy, recoil, aim punch | [WEAPON_TUNING](docs/WEAPON_TUNING.md) |
| Loadouts, grenades, launcher, smoke, Claymore | [EQUIPMENT](docs/EQUIPMENT.md) |
| Match rules, movement, bots, controls, server settings, messages | [GAMEPLAY](docs/GAMEPLAY.md) |
| One map | [MAPS](docs/MAPS.md) + `docs/maps/<map>.md` |
| Map sizing, themes, textures, new map | [MAPS](docs/MAPS.md) |
| Cells, material HP, collapse, cell replication | [DESTRUCTION](docs/DESTRUCTION.md) |
| Skins, FPS rig, clothing | [CHARACTERS](docs/CHARACTERS.md) |
| HUD, minimap | [HUD](docs/HUD.md) |
| Fog of war, drones, graffiti | [RECON](docs/RECON.md) |
| Sound | [AUDIO](docs/AUDIO.md) |
| Graphics settings, resolution | [PERFORMANCE](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) |
| LAN, EOS, capacity | [ONLINE](docs/ONLINE.md) |
| Setup, compile, versions | [BUILD](docs/BUILD.md) |
| macOS package or release | [PACKAGE_MAC](docs/PACKAGE_MAC.md) |
| Windows or Linux package | [PACKAGE_DESKTOP](docs/PACKAGE_DESKTOP.md) |
| Submodules, licences, cleanup, publication | [ASSETS](docs/ASSETS.md) |
| Unsure what a test proves | [TESTING](docs/TESTING.md) |

## Cross-platform C++ rules

**A green Mac build proves nothing about Linux or Windows.** UE's Apple toolchain
adds `-Wno-range-loop-analysis` and `-Wno-shorten-64-to-32`, and Apple Clang does
not report the MSVC-only cases below. All four caused real failed builds (commits
`d292554` Linux, `839452c` Windows). Follow them in all new code, tests and probes:

1. **Range-for never copies through `const auto`.** Write `const auto& X:` or
   `auto* X:`. `for(const auto X:Array)` over `TObjectPtr` (and any non-trivially
   copyable or large element) fails on Linux (`-Wrange-loop-construct`).
2. **No local may hide a class member, including private inherited ones.** In any
   `UObject`/`AActor` member function or its lambdas, avoid `Role`, `RemoteRole`,
   `Owner`, `Instigator`, `Tags`, `Children`, `Layers`, `Controller`, `Mesh`...
   MSVC raises C4458 as an error even for inaccessible members such as
   `AActor::Role`; Clang stays silent. Rename the local (`LoadoutRole`).
3. **Convert to `bool` explicitly.** `const bool Odd=(I%2)!=0;`, never
   `const bool Odd=I%2;`: C4800 is an error on MSVC.
4. **`FVector` is double, so `FMath::RoundToInt` is `int64`.** Round/Floor/Ceil/Trunc
   of a double return `int64`. Use `RoundToInt32`, `FloorToInt32`, `CeilToInt32` or
   `TruncToInt32` wherever the result reaches `int32`, and always inside brace
   initialization (`FIntPoint`, `FIntVector`, `{...}` arguments), where narrowing is
   a hard MSVC error.

Run this over changed files before finishing C++ work. Hits for rules 1 and 2 need
review, not automatic rewriting; value types such as `FVector` are accepted today:

```sh
git diff --name-only HEAD -- 'Source/*.cpp' 'Source/*.h' | xargs -r grep -nE \
  'for\( *const auto +[A-Za-z_]+ *:|\b(const )?(auto|F[A-Z][A-Za-z]+|int32|float) *[&*]? *(Role|RemoteRole|Instigator)\b *[=;(]|bool +[A-Za-z_]+ *= *[^;=!<>]*%[^;=!<>]*;|\{[^}]*FMath::(Round|Floor|Ceil|Trunc)ToInt\('
```

Say which platforms were really compiled. Windows and Linux are only verified by
`scripts/package-windows.ps1` or the `unreal-builder` Linux task.

## Working rules

- Never claim a test, compile, licence check or visual result without evidence.
  `nullrhi` runs do not prove rendering, audio or subjective balance; geometry
  checks are not playtests; local two-process runs are not a physical LAN test.
- Edit or move `.uasset`/`.umap` only through Unreal, never by binary patching.
  Asset migrations are versioned `scripts/setup_*.py` scripts run through Unreal
  Python: back up, save only the owned packages, verify protected hashes, and
  stay idempotent. Never rerun an art import for a numeric tuning change.
- In Unreal Python, build rotations with named `pitch`, `yaw`, `roll` arguments.
- Keep art references in Blueprint defaults and original supplied art immutable;
  generate owned derivatives. Never load from Downloads at runtime.
- Commit asset submodules first, then their gitlinks here. Never publish licensed
  files or change repository visibility implicitly. See docs/ASSETS.md.
- `Config/EOS.local.ini` is private and ignored (mode 0600); never print it.
- Do not modify `/Users/agea/git/csgopen/eclipse-recoil` (the original game).
- Run the topic doc's **Verify** tests for what changed, not the whole suite.
- Respect the user's stated scope; ask before packaging or uploading.

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Authority:** combat, ammo, teams, scoring, protection, respawn, recoil, spread and
  damage are server authoritative. No client-selected shot direction, damage, cell
  mutation or unrestricted position RPC. Movement goes through `UERMovement` and
  saved moves. Cosmetic RNG never consumes gameplay or geometry RNG.
- **Aim:** `GetEffectiveAimRotation` / `GetViewRotation` combine input, worksheet
  recoil and aim punch once. `ControlRotation`, capsule and hitboxes stay untouched.
- **Maps:** templates are deterministic from a seed, half-turn paired, validated
  atomically, 1000m² per team-size unit ±10% of area. Never scale meshes, doors,
  stairs, materials or cells to fit. Sample one half, then rotate it.
- **Destruction:** one path, logical 5cm cells. Server owns HP; clients reconstruct
  from the protocol descriptor and apply complete shard manifests only, failing
  closed. HP values are calibrated to cell size: changing resolution or thickness
  needs recalibration.
- **Characters:** 20 selectable skins (10 per team) with stable indices. The FPS rig
  and poses are independent of world skins. Never call
  `FBoneContainer::SetDisableRetargeting` in gameplay: it crashes cooked builds.
- **Packaging:** the only map list is `MapsToCook` in `Config/DefaultGame.ini`. Add
  every new playable map there; never pass a separate `-map` list.

## Documentation rules

- Docs describe **what is true now**. Edit the relevant section in place; delete
  what stopped being true. Add a new file only for a new subsystem, then add a row
  to the table above.
- One topic per file, so a task costs few tokens: keep files small, with **Code** and
  **Verify** sections, and link across topics instead of repeating content.
- No dated entries, revision narratives, "latest", "supersedes", "previously" or
  execution logs. Test evidence and reasoning go in commit messages and
  `Saved/Testing`, not here.
- Prefer pointing to code over copying numbers: `ERServer::Settings()` owns tuning
  defaults, `ERMapCatalog` the map list, `character_catalog.py` the skin labels.
- Keep this file short: only rules an agent would otherwise get wrong. README and
  docs are in English.
